# Plan the development of your client's site - Menu Maker by Qwenta

# Scenario:
You are a front-end developer at Webgencia. 

This week, you’re being tasked with an assignment that’s a little out of the ordinary. You will lead, prepare, and plan a website development project, but you won’t be involved on the development side.

In fact, one of your clients, Qwenta, wants to develop a “Menu Maker”.  It’s a website that allows restaurateurs to easily display and format their menus in a few simple clicks.  

This is an opportunity for you to implement an agile work methodology and collaborate with the product owner, Soufiane. 
Soufiane has invited you to the project signoff meeting that will take place in two weeks with Qwenta’s project manager, John.

Subject: Menu Maker by Qwenta Project

From: Soufiane

To: Me

Hello,

As promised, here’s your invitation! I’d like to take a moment to provide you with more information. 

What’s Already Completed
I’ve attached information on what we’ve been working on with the Product team over the past few days: 

The desktop mockup created by our UI designer, showing the how the website is expected to look.
The functional specifications document, which outlines the website’s development requirements.
The user stories table in Notion, which shows the requirements and expectations of website users.
 
What’s Left to Do
You will help me prepare for the three-part overview meeting with John:

Develop a monitoring system that will provide ideas for this project that can be reused within the team. 
At the same time, define the technical specifications of the “Menu Maker by Qwenta” website.
Organize the project management for the website's development. 

So, before our meeting with John, you’ll need to send me:

A presentation that showcases your monitoring work. It should contain the link to your configured monitoring tool, including screenshots demonstrating:
how information sources were selected.
how information is categorized.
how information can be commented on and distributed.
the information generated from the monitoring process that you will use to define the technical specifications.

The technical specifications for the “Menu Maker by Qwenta” tool (maximum 15 pages):
I’ve attached the template document that we use at Webgencia. You’ll need to fill it out using the documents available. 
To really sell the client on the solution, you’ll need to explain your choices and their benefits!

A project planning presentation which includes:
The link to the configured project management tool.
The Kanban board, created with the tool, listing all the project tasks in four categories (to do, in progress, to be tested, complete).

I’ll let you digest all this information. You’ve got plenty to keep you busy for now. Let’s talk soon! 

Thanks!

Soufiane

One week later

You sent your work to Soufiane, who replied by email.

Wow!

Congratulations on your hard work, I approve of everything!

All that’s left now is to get it ready to present it to John. John isn’t a very technical person, so you’ll need to be clear and convincing, without overwhelming him with terms he won’t understand. 

Please send me a presentation which I’ll share it with him before the kick-off meeting. 

This presentation should explain the chosen technical solution, highlighting:

A visual presentation of the technical specifications (diagrams, schemas, illustrative images, etc.) so that he understands how the website will work.
The communication plan to determine how and when Webgencia and Qwenta will communicate during the project. This involves identifying the project phases in which communication will take place, in what format discussions will be conducted, and who will be involved.

This is the final stretch before the meeting. Good luck!

Soufiane
